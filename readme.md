# Quick bind

## Why?

Hey, henlo, this repository serves the glorious purpose of installing bind and isc-dhcp-server and coping a simple config so I don't have to. I will probably make it better in the near future but, ¡¡No promises!!
Feel free to use!!

# How to use

Clone and execute the respective script depening on the type of machine that you're installing:

```
./install_client.sh
```
```
./install_server.sh
```
